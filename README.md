# Get the weather

A Java Spring Boot application.

Using HTTP Requests, this app retrieves information about the weather in a specific city.

https://openweathermap.org/

## How it works?

On a GET request, the user provides the name of the city in the URL.

A first HTTP request is made which converts the city's string name to latitude and longitude.

Based on those, a second HTTP request is made which responds with details about the weather in that specific place.

## Enjoy!
